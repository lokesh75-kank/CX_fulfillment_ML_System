## Questions Leadership Might Ask

**Q: How accurate is this?**
A: Root causes have confidence scores (92% in our example). Evidence from multiple methods (SHAP, diff-in-diff). Not guesswork.

**Q: What if it's wrong?**
A: Recommendations include guardrails. Experiments have rollback criteria. We know the risks upfront.

**Q: How much time does this save?**
A: 10x faster resolution. Days → hours. Less debugging time = more building time.

**Q: What's the ROI?**
A: Faster problem resolution, better customer experience, higher team velocity, data-driven decisions.

## Bottom Line

**Before**: Reactive, slow, guesswork, high customer impact

**After**: Proactive, fast, data-driven, minimal customer impact

**The difference**: From days to hours. From reactive to proactive. From guesswork to evidence.
